# Proxy-Scraper-and-Checker

## Overview
Simple tools to find and check proxies.

## Modules
### scraper.py
- Gets proxies from websites and saves them to `proxies.txt`.
### checker.py
- Checks if proxies are available and writes available proxies to `working_proxies.txt`.

## Usage
1. Run `scraper.py`; it builds `proxies.txt` and then starts `checker.py` for you.
2. Wait for the check to finish and review `working_proxies.txt`. Run again if the network fails.

## Credits
These tools are ones I found online and modified; I don't know who the original authors are.ðŸ’€
