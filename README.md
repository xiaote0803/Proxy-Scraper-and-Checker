## Modules
### scraper.py

- Gets proxies from websites and saves them to `proxies.txt`.
  
### checker.py

- Checks if proxies are available and writes available proxies to `working_proxies.txt`.

## Usage

1. Run `scraper.py`; it builds `proxies.txt` and then starts `checker.py` for you.
2. Wait for the check to finish and review `working_proxies.txt`. Run again if the network fails.
